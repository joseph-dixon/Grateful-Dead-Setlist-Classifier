# Grateful-Dead-Setlist-Classifier
The Grateful Dead famously never repeated a setlist. After touring for 30 years and playing thousands of live shows, they've left a remarkable and relentlessly unique live catalogue. As the years and decades rolled on, the band layered in new songs and archived others, leaving each year's setlist corpus with a unique fingerprint. Given an unlabeled setlist, can a Naive Bayes model learn to correctly classify what year a concert was performed in?

This project began by scraping Setlist.net to obtain every Grateful Dead setlist on record. I then wrote a seperate script to clean and categorize the setlists into a format amenable to creating the NB model. Finally, drawing on Midevel's Naive Bayes tutorial, documented at https://github.com/Midvel/medium_jupyter_notes/tree/master/, I built this Naive Bayes from scratch. Using an 80/20 split for training and testing, I achieved ~80% sensitivity.
